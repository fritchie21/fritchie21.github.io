We are friends, biologists, lovers of birds, plants, and wild spaces. We first met in 2005 in grad school at the University of California, Riverside, where we bonded over a love of birding. We continued to cross paths over the next two decades, through Scotland (Sonya in Glasgow, Sarah in Aberdeen), and now in Auburn, AL.

We both love having gardens, but believe those gardens should also be a functioning part of the ecosystem. Unfortunately, non-native plants do very little for biodiversity, as the vast majority of our insects are specialists (97%) and require the plants with which they co-evolved. Similarly, while birds may eat the fruits of some non-native species, virtually all songbirds feed their nestlings caterpillars ... which require native plants. Did you know a single chickadee nest with 4 nestlings will consume 6000-9000 caterpillars before fledging?

Because we love the birds (and the insects), we believe in cultivating yards that will continue to support our wildlife populations. As such, we also choose not to use any insecticides on our plants. You may have read in the news recently that most milkweed plants found in commercial nurseries contain insecticides at levels that are harmful to the monarch caterpillars that would eat them. We’ll be honest: it’s hard to grow a perfect-looking milkweed without killing all the things that want to eat it. So our milkweeds- and other plants- may not always look perfect, but you can be sure that they are supporting our wildlife food webs!
