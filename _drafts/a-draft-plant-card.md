<!-- plant:type = on "menu page" lists a tid-bit, could use for some category -->

A deer-resistant herbaceous perennial native to prairies, fields and open woodlands.  It can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions, from sand to clay to loam, moist to dry.  Though it can be drought-tolerant, it would prefer a moister site.  Flowers will reach 3-5 ft in height, and will attract all sorts of pollinators and songbirds!  Full to part sun.  Excellent cut flowers.
